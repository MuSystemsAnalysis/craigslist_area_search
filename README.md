Craigslist Scraper
=================

What is this?
-----
This is a web-scraper that will take in a single string as an argument, search craigslist in all
American regions/cities as defined by craigslist's regional breakdown, and return the regions in
which the term appears in the title of a for sale posting. The data will then be returned as a
list. This is a project for Fa2015 Systems Analysis and Design.


DEPENDENCIES
----
* Python3 3.4.3
* Beautiful Soup 4.4.1

These requirements should be checked against requirements.txt for accuracy.

ALSO: use the included copy of sites.html in lieu of repeatedly scraping craigslist.
That is frowned upon, and they will ban me/you/us.
