Craigslist Scraper
=================
by Marshall Ehlinger

WHAT?
-----
This is a web-scraper that will take in a single string as an argument, search craigslist in all
American regions/cities as defined by craigslist's regional breakdown, and return the regions in
which the term appears in the title of a for sale posting. The data will then be returned as a
list.


DEPENDENCIES
-----------
This scraper uses Python3 and the Beautiful Soup library. 
The results of "pip freeze" inside of the virtualenv are available under requirements.txt
